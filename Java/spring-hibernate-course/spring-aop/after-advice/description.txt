This topic is about Spring-AOP @After advice.
This advice is similar to finally block in try/catch/finally that will always run.
It can be used for logging the exceptions or auditing, run a code regardless of outcome of a method.

Note that it does not have acess to the exceptions
Note that it will always run before @AfterThrowing or @AfterReturning
